## Tips
While you are free to tackle this however you'd like, here are some tips:

- Break the website down into smaller components and focus on completing each component.
- Use separate css files for each component to stay organized.
- Use a combination of flex and grid to arrange the elements on the page.
- Make frequent commits as you work.
- As a last resort, you can always inspect the live demo. However, try to build as much as you can from scratch first!
